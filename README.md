This repository is an example for how to run the Kirby CMS on a Nginx webserver. It is an example project for the Nginx config file, which is described in the [official cookbook article](https://getkirby.com/docs/cookbook/setup/nginx). The actual Nginx config can be found in `default.conf`.

## Developer setup
If you want to start this setup, you're gonna need `docker` and `docker compose`.
